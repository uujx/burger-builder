# Burger Builder

A web app for users to build and buy custom burgers.

Basically, it is a shopping page where users can order burgers as they want and checkout. Users can create an account and login to place an order and they can see their order history.

## Front-end

The front-end is built with **React** plus **Redux** for state management and **react-router** for routing in SPA.

## Back-end

This is a front-end project so I chose to use **Firebase** as an off-the-shelf back-end that I can use with minimum effort to handle authentication and database.
